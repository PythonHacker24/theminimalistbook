          What is Tmux? Tmux is a Terminal Multiplexer Application for Linux and MacOS for managing terminal sessions and Windows. It is to be mentioned that Tmux is not a terminal emulator, instead, it’s a terminal application, a binary that allows you to stay productive over your terminal. It doesn’t matter which terminal emulator you are using (although I recommend the Suckless Terminal). The functionality of managing Windows and the session doesn’t happen on the desktop GUI side but on the terminal session, you are working with.

          Preface: I have been looking for simple solutions in nearly everything related to computing. A lot of software designed these days is not designed per your requirements but as per companies&rsquo; profit. Hence, most of these solutions end up sucking your time and energy and need to be replaced by more optimised solutions that would boost your productivity in the right way. RSS Feed is something that I found after searching for solutions related to subscribing to websites or creators without sucking much resources and design that is reliable to the user itself.

I prefer manual deployment of applications over automated (and even serverless) methods. Although they are convenient and require less effort by the developers, they are bound to the providers and offer less control over the underlying system.

          Linux Kernel is an Open-Source Software and the user is free to modify and customise it as per the requirements. The modification of the Kernel requires a deep understanding of the working of the Kernel, although patches are available to make the Kernel optimised for specific hardware. Linux Kernel Source Code has various options to configure the drivers, modules, preferences on hardware options, etc. This part can be studied by the user and is pretty much easy to work with.

Linux Kernel has been one of the most important software ever written and is even considered one of the biggest projects ever undertaken by a single person. The idea of the Linux Kernel was initiated by Linus Torvalds, a student from the University of Helsinki and is maintained by him to date (while writing this article).

But then I learnt the suckless ecosystem and eventually shifted to it as my full-time environment.

Some of the underlying concepts remain the same for any other distros but it is mainly intended for Linux.

      <p>Imagine being away from the computer for a couple of minutes and getting to know that the system has been compromised and a backdoor has been installed into the system. “The system was locked?” doesn’t matter, without the bios security implementation (which most probably would not be implemented), all the files can be recovered without any login made to the Login Screen.</p>
<p>This goes with the story of me trying to get my Wi-Fi troubleshooting in Arch Linux where I was trying to upgrade the Kernel of my System to get the Wi-Fi working properly (as mentioned in the previous blog. By the way, I got the Wi-Fi working). I used an Arch Installation medium to get into the system and extract all my backup data into a USB.</p>
<p>Doing this is simple given that some physical access to the device is granted. By automating this process with a key-strokes injector, the process can be streamlined to most extent. Even backdoors can be planted in the system and run as background processes.</p>
<p>Now first, let me get the expectations of the line. This is not something very new thing that I have found. It’s just I found it with my way of exploring the computers and troubleshooting a Custom Arch Linux Build. So if the technique exists, great! the world remains as it is.</p>
<h2 id="getting-the-tools-for-the-action">Getting the Tools for the Action</h2>
<p>What you need for a basic purpose is just a USB drive with some standard space on it (I expect that it is more than 8GB or something, would be good to have one). Just install Arch Installation medium into it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the image from the Arch Official Website</li>
<li>Use Balena Etcher or anything you like to flash the image</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you have an Arch Installation Medium, get to the system want to get access to.</p>
<p>For super fast action, get a USB Ducky or some microcontroller that you can manage to program for keystroke injections. You just have to record the exact command you want and you can pair them for maximum speed and avoid typing on the keyboard while the attack happens (be legit, only on devices you have permission).</p>
<h2 id="hack-the-world--action-phase">Hack the World! — Action Phase</h2>
<p>Let’s call the Arch Installation Medium as Attacker USB for the sake of making this blog look cooler.</p>
<p>Plug that Attacker USB into the system and get the command line ready after login (the Attacker USB login, default ones)
At this point, you might need you connect the system to the internet in case you need to access the internet for uploading or downloading. [Command: iwctl station <interface> connect <SSID> ] and then Enter the Password for the internet.
Now mount the drives of the system to the Attacker USB. There are several steps for this so I am listing this after these bullet points (I am new to Medium while writing this so spare with me) [TAG: MOUNT_SECTION]
Now you can go to the /mnt and get access to all the files in it. I recommend chrooting into it and then exploring the files if there is enough time. This way, you can use the installed binaries and get things from the internet into the system. [Chrooting Command: arch-chroot /mnt /bin/bash]
[MOUNT_SECTION]: Here, I will show how to mount the drive to the USB Medium</p>
<p>Do lsblk and you will get the drives listed
They would be like /sda, /sdb and would have sub-drives like /sda1 and /sda2. Something like that (trust me, I am an Engineer)
With some common sense, I can safely say that the disk might be big enough like hundreds of GB, bigger than the USB I think so for most of the time.
Let’s say it’s sda for the drive you want to access.
First, make a boot file in the /mnt folder in the Attacker USB</p>
<ul>
<li><code>mkdir /mnt/boot</code></li>
<li><code>mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot</code></li>
<li><code>mount /dev/sda2 /mnt</code>
Quick Disclaimer, it depends on the partition of the filesystem into the drive. The cases I have provided here are the most common ones found (by my experience)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="post-exploitation">Post Exploitation</h2>
<p>If you manage to get into the drives or chroot into it (would be awesome if this works), then that’s it. This is what it was all about. You got the files without any Login Screen asking for passwords. The files are compromised.</p>
<p>What I did in the case was, I looked for /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files which I would have used with Hashcat to crack the login passwords. Now a remote backdoor can be set up by planting it to files that autostart and even trying to hide it to prevent the user from suspecting it.</p>
<p>Having an Access Point handy with a Keystroke Injector and Attacker USB can prove to have a very fast execution of the task given that the system is studied for automated attacks. Manual procedures work the best but take time.</p>
<p>This was it, my story of debugging the Wi-Fi and finding this technique to get access to my files. This methodology can be used for physical penetration tests or even to get out the files from a crashed system (like if the user deletes the /boot file and reboots)</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am a very simple person studying computers and have some knowledge about them. Everything here is just for learning purposes and not for some shady purposes. Do it on your systems and systems you have permission to do this. Be careful, you may end up wiping the disk, so I as a simple author take no responsibility for any loss. I have a lot of things and problems to solve so would likely not engage in something like resolving issues. Have a good time learning!</p>

          Preface: I have been going through the book ‚ÄúLinux Kernel Development‚Äù by Robert Love which I highly recommend for understanding the Linux Kernel in depth. I decided to write this article to explain ‚ÄúLinux Processes‚Äù simply and concisely. The topic itself is broad and is not explained into the deepest of it, but essential for Linux Administrators, Developers and even Linux users to appreciate the beauty of the Kernel they make use of every day.

          I was looking for an article like this a few days ago, which I didn‚Äôt find at that time, so I did the deployment on my own and came up with this article to prevent other developers from saving those efforts and focusing on development. I am not explaining every single step and have provided links for references.
I prefer manual deployment of applications over automated (and even serverless) methods. Although they are convenient and require less effort by the developers, they are bound to the providers and offer less control over the underlying system.

          Linux Kernel is an Open-Source Software and the user is free to modify and customise it as per the requirements. The modification of the Kernel requires a deep understanding of the working of the Kernel, although patches are available to make the Kernel optimised for specific hardware. Linux Kernel Source Code has various options to configure the drivers, modules, preferences on hardware options, etc. This part can be studied by the user and is pretty much easy to work with.

          Introduction and Context I was going through the book ‚ÄúLinux Kernel Development‚Äù by Robert Love, an absolute guide to getting started with Linux Kernel Development and a highly recommended book for understanding the core of the Linux Kernel. Linux Kernel has been one of the most important software ever written and is even considered one of the biggest projects ever undertaken by a single person. The idea of the Linux Kernel was initiated by Linus Torvalds, a student from the University of Helsinki and is maintained by him to date (while writing this article).

          Prior Statements: This is a concise guide on the Linux Shell Scripting while consolidating all the facts about the Linux Shell for quick developer‚Äôs reference while using Linux. I am referencing the Bash (Bourne-Again Shell) which is the default shell for Linux-based systems. I will also be providing references and external links to dive into depth and not fill the article with too much explanation about a single topic which is not universally required by all the readers.

          Suckless utilities have been my favourite at this time and kind of essentials for my use of the computer. I have been using Arch Linux for a fair amount of time now and I started using it with XFCE for few weeks. I would appreciate the XFCE desktop environment for it‚Äôs smoothness and light-weight nature with works really fine when newly shifting on Arch Linux. But then I learnt the suckless ecosystem and eventually shifted to it as my full-time environment.

          Statistics are clear on the fact that 96.3% (while writing this article) of the servers use Linux as their Operating System which is no doubt what every other Linux user on this Earth expects. I believe that the Linux Administrator has to take the shot about the configuration of Networking in Linux Based Server. Some of the underlying concepts remain the same for any other distros but it is mainly intended for Linux.

          Today, I completed the whole read of the book ‚ÄúLinux Kernel in a Nutshell‚Äù by Greg Kroah-Hartman and I highly recommend that you go through it if you want to understand how to build your custom configuration of Linux Kernel and all you need to know about all the nuts and bolts. It‚Äôs always great to have such handbooks around the desk.
This blog is about why it‚Äôs so awesome to look into the operating system you are using with your hardware and why have a grasp on the Low-Level aspects of a computer.

          While writing this blog, I was reading the book ‚ÄúLinux Kernel in a Nutshell‚Äù by Greg Kroab-Hartman and as far as the pages of the book are concerned, it seems to be a two-day read (this is a handbook so reading it once and having around the desk is super useful). By the way, the author has the book left open for download http://www.kroah.com/lkn/ so check that out if you want to follow up.

<p>My story how I blew up Pacman Package Manager
How to reinstall the Pacman Package Manager
If you only care about the second part, skip the first one.</p>
<h2 id="the-scenario--blow-it-up">The Scenario ‚Äî Blow it Up</h2>
<p>I was trying to install the pacman game from the Internet to get it running on my Arch Linux Terminal (I use Suckless Terminal BTW). When I got it installed and played it, it was super awesome. It was fun to the point that I decided to add it to my /usr/bin directory to make it my usual command and play it whenever I want. This is where I messed up and replaced the Pacman Package Manager binary with the Pacman Game binary. And now I ended up losing it and unable to update or install anything to my system and enabled me to play a Pacman Game.</p>
<p>Now when you are in a relaxed state and don‚Äôt have a broad angle of thinking what you are doing, you ending messing things up. And it may be a case happened to you too and you might too have blown you Pacman Package Manager by any reason (trust me, you messed up).</p>
<p>It is a 2 minutes solution which took me 2 hours to find out. I am including the steps here so that you can save your good time.</p>
<h2 id="looking-on-the-brighter-side">Looking on the Brighter Side</h2>
<p>The 2 hours went by where some of the good hours that Arch Linux gives you frequently. Last time, it was a Wi-Fi driver error due to outdated kernel which I documented in my other article. This is what I use Arch for: not just getting my system fast and make it the most custom tailored operating system ever, but also learning a lot of things through challenges like this. I actually love these challenges that come in my way to make me think valid approaches and tackle that problem.</p>
<p>I first thought of using pacstrap (which of course was not a command in my Arch Distro). To overcome this, I got my Arch Installation media (super useful to have: for installing Arch in new systems and debugging existing machines as well) ready, which is a 16GB USB. I plugged it in, used <code>iwctl</code> to connect to the Wi-Fi, mount the SSD with my Arch Linux with the commands <code>mkdir /mnt/boot</code>, <code>mount /dev/sda1</code> <code>/mnt/boot</code>, <code>mount /dev/sda2 /mnt</code> (mine was sda labelled). Then I pacstrapped it: <code>pacstrap /mnt base base-devel</code>. And it failed.</p>
<p>Then spent time with the the Arch Wiki (this takes the most amout of time) and got the whole git repo of Pacman Package Manager cloned in my system. Followed all the steps to get the meson build ready as well as ninja build and install. At last, didn‚Äôt work (it will work in the solutions part).</p>
<p>After this part, I did make it happen. It was just a small configuration of adding repositories to the configuration, from which the Arch Linux will install all of it‚Äôs tools.</p>
<h2 id="solution-to-the-problem-getting-pacman-package-manager-installed-on-the-system">Solution to the Problem: Getting Pacman Package Manager Installed on the System</h2>
<ol>
<li>Get the Pacman Package Manager git repository cloned in your system <code>git clone https://gitlab.archlinux.org/pacman/pacman.git</code></li>
<li>Get the Build and Install Procedures done :</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><code>$ meson build</code></li>
<li><code>$ ninja -C build</code></li>
<li><code>$ ninja -C build install</code></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Edit the pacman.conf file: File location: <code>/etc/pacman.conf</code>. Add these lines in the pacman.conf.</li>
</ol>
<p>[core]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist</p>
<p>[extra]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist</p>
<p>[community]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Update the mirrorlist with the Official Arch Linux Mirrorlist Generator. Just selected the desired location and other settings. Then just copy and paste them in the file <code>/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Arch Official Mirrorlist Generator: <code>https://archlinux.org/mirrorlist/</code></p>
<p>And the Pacman Package Manager would run as expected with the command <code>pacman</code>. Try doing <code>pacman -Syu</code> which updates your system for testing it.</p>
<p>Official Webpage for Pacman: <a href="https://archlinux.org/pacman/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >https://archlinux.org/pacman/</a></p>
<p>If still you Pacman Package Manager doesn‚Äôt work out, I am really sorry for your loss. You need to try harder to get it done. I would like to know if there are even more ways to solve this problem (or even things can go even more wrong). Although theoretically it must work by now, but in case if it doesn‚Äôt, happy solving the issue.</p>

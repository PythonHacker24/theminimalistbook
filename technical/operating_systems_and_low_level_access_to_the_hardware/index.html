          Preface: I have been going through the book ‚ÄúLinux Kernel Development‚Äù by Robert Love which I highly recommend for understanding the Linux Kernel in depth. I decided to write this article to explain ‚ÄúLinux Processes‚Äù simply and concisely. The topic itself is broad and is not explained into the deepest of it, but essential for Linux Administrators, Developers and even Linux users to appreciate the beauty of the Kernel they make use of every day.

          I was looking for an article like this a few days ago, which I didn‚Äôt find at that time, so I did the deployment on my own and came up with this article to prevent other developers from saving those efforts and focusing on development. I am not explaining every single step and have provided links for references.
I prefer manual deployment of applications over automated (and even serverless) methods. Although they are convenient and require less effort by the developers, they are bound to the providers and offer less control over the underlying system.

          Linux Kernel is an Open-Source Software and the user is free to modify and customise it as per the requirements. The modification of the Kernel requires a deep understanding of the working of the Kernel, although patches are available to make the Kernel optimised for specific hardware. Linux Kernel Source Code has various options to configure the drivers, modules, preferences on hardware options, etc. This part can be studied by the user and is pretty much easy to work with.

          Introduction and Context I was going through the book ‚ÄúLinux Kernel Development‚Äù by Robert Love, an absolute guide to getting started with Linux Kernel Development and a highly recommended book for understanding the core of the Linux Kernel. Linux Kernel has been one of the most important software ever written and is even considered one of the biggest projects ever undertaken by a single person. The idea of the Linux Kernel was initiated by Linus Torvalds, a student from the University of Helsinki and is maintained by him to date (while writing this article).

          Prior Statements: This is a concise guide on the Linux Shell Scripting while consolidating all the facts about the Linux Shell for quick developer‚Äôs reference while using Linux. I am referencing the Bash (Bourne-Again Shell) which is the default shell for Linux-based systems. I will also be providing references and external links to dive into depth and not fill the article with too much explanation about a single topic which is not universally required by all the readers.

          Suckless utilities have been my favourite at this time and kind of essentials for my use of the computer. I have been using Arch Linux for a fair amount of time now and I started using it with XFCE for few weeks. I would appreciate the XFCE desktop environment for it‚Äôs smoothness and light-weight nature with works really fine when newly shifting on Arch Linux. But then I learnt the suckless ecosystem and eventually shifted to it as my full-time environment.

The Scenario ‚Äî Blow it Up I was trying to install the pacman game from the Internet to get it running on my Arch Linux Terminal (I use Suckless Terminal BTW). When I got it installed and played it, it was super awesome.

          Statistics are clear on the fact that 96.3% (while writing this article) of the servers use Linux as their Operating System which is no doubt what every other Linux user on this Earth expects. I believe that the Linux Administrator has to take the shot about the configuration of Networking in Linux Based Server. Some of the underlying concepts remain the same for any other distros but it is mainly intended for Linux.

      <p>Today, I completed the whole read of the book <strong>‚ÄúLinux Kernel in a Nutshell‚Äù by Greg Kroah-Hartman</strong> and I highly recommend that you go through it if you want to understand how to build your custom configuration of Linux Kernel and all you need to know about all the nuts and bolts. It‚Äôs always great to have such handbooks around the desk.</p>
<p>This blog is about why it‚Äôs so awesome to look into the operating system you are using with your hardware and why have a grasp on the Low-Level aspects of a computer. I am going to go philosophical in this blog about the reasoning behind why to leave what you are doing and explore under the hood of things around you. When I say computers, it‚Äôs not bound to something like a Laptop or Desktop but comprises a whole lot of things that you have lying around. Like your Wireless Access Point (commonly called a wireless router), most probably it‚Äôs the case that it is running a whole Linux-based Operating System in it. Owning something might be easy but having an insight into how it functions is something amazing. When you spend a lot of time figuring out all of this, it becomes extremely obvious about how they work rather than the complexity that we predict while accessing these things.</p>
<p><em>‚ÄúThe world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes‚Äù ‚Äî Sherlock Holmes&quot;</em></p>
<p>My last few blogs have been about why I use Arch Operating System. Today, I am not gonna state much about that fact (I use Arch btw). Recently, I was learning the <strong>Rust Programming Language</strong> which I consider to be one of my favourite languages. Yes, I love <strong>Golang</strong> too and I am learning it now. The control that these languages give you on the low-level side is so awesome that I got to learn about Stack Memory and Heap Memory from the Rust Docs itself. This makes you a better programmer than the traditional one trying to look into the syntax and goes on to use it blindly. The Rust Programming Language is now being used in the Linux Kernel which is awesome in a way. The C Language is from my perspective is what I respect a lot and trying to learn it in as depth as possible. <strong>C Language</strong> is something that gives so much control to the developer that the security falls into the hands of the developer. So I consider Rust as an ideal language for most purposes. More on Rust Language in some other blog, there is a lot to cover about that.</p>
<p>Now languages like Rust, Golang, C, etc. hand over the control of the hardware to a great extent to the developer. This means that the first layer that they are going to interact with is the Operating System. Modern devices comprise operating systems which makes them easier to develop rather than hardcoding the firmware from scratch (there are a lot of reasons why companies don‚Äôt prefer this much. One of them is building the Kernel from scratch which is a huge work to get done). Interacting with the Operating System and building native applications is I believe a huge advantage. Optimising a program for a specific OS works out well and helps avoid a lot of bugs. All of this comes when the developer has a keen knowledge of Operating Systems and Internal Hardware.</p>
<p>Having a grasp on Operating Systems makes it easy to decode the world of electronics. Like, consider my case. I remember I was trying to hack into my TP-LINK ‚Äî WR720N by physical access. While I was plugging in the UART ports and trying to learn <strong>Firmware Extraction Techniques</strong>, I learned that it has Linux-based firmware. I use Linux on my Desktop Hardware which uses the same Kernel that the small Wireless Router was using. Isn‚Äôt it cool that while I know my operating system in depth, I understand my router as well? Almost the same principles apply to it, like the network management. Operating Systems have networking tools built into them for internet connectivity and networking is the core for Wireless Access Points. This makes the router more understandable while using it, and now you have more control over your devices.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs just the optimisations that are made while developing these devices. A Wireless Access Point has almost I believe no need for Keyboard and Mouse Interaction. So these drivers can be removed, which optimises the storage and results in greater speed. A functional Operating System on a Desktop would need this! it‚Äôs hard to work without a Keyboard (and sometimes a mouse but if you use NeoVim like me and CLI with Tmux most of the time, then it should be fine). Now consider that you are building a media server on your <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong> and you have SSH to interact with it. Why would you need a Printer and Scanner Drivers if you don‚Äôt use them? If you want an Ethernet connection, why go with Wi-Fi drivers? Make your system lightweight and fast enough.</p>
<p>These are some things that you would be able to optimise at low levels of your computers. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you are a High-Level Language user working on Web Application Development, having a good command of Low-Level can help you optimise your products. Personally, I like to explore the ecosystems of devices and make my Arch Distro faster for development.</p>

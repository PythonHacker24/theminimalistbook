          Preface I have been reviewing a lot of literature related to the job market in software engineering and analysing what stands apart and what gets rejected. While writing this article, I am at a very young age and I am very grateful to say that I had an opportunity to interview people for hiring them into a startup, despite my role as a DevSecOps intern (I was that one multi-tasking startup guy).

          Preface: This article is about my experiences and opinions based on my knowledge. We all have an unfair advantage since we all are unique and using that to get better in the market would take you much further. I have been working with software for like a few years while being a university student and learnt a lot from all the amazing people I worked with and followed. While I put down things that I learnt, it has to be noted that your opinions and experiences may vary and I greatly respect that.

          The Current System of Workspace Working for a company or an organisation to become financially stable surely makes you and your family proud, and certainly, when you were in the 90s, that’s what most people termed as widely successful. It’s absolutely important to make money to have a nice home and send your kids to a good school. And most of the time that works and maybe certainly enough. This method of surviving has dominated for a while now and has shaped the current workspace.

          On June 10 1997, Apple Computers released the Apple 2 computer which was one of the first mass-produced computers in the world. It was a success and had a sale of 5–6 million units till the year of 1993. There was a small documentary on this by Bloomberg Originals (here on YouTube) about the same with Steve Wozniak. Now I am not a 90’s kid or something. I was born in the year 2004 and had no connection with these computers.

          I have been using Arch Linux for days now for the sake of having full control over the hardware as well as the software (not moved to LibreBoot or CoreBoot but someday in the future). I have been utilising the suckless utilities and ricing my system for the best look I can have and take the privilege of saying “I use Arch BTW”. Since the total control of the Hardware and Software falls in the hands of the user and Arch repository Pacman releases even the latest packages, way before the software is even stable creating a sensation of being the early user of the tool at the same time being ready to crash out the system.

      <p><em><strong>Preface:</strong></em> <em>This article is about my experiences and opinions based on my knowledge. We all have an unfair advantage since we all are unique and using that to get better in the market would take you much further. I have been working with software for like a few years while being a university student and learnt a lot from all the amazing people I worked with and followed. While I put down things that I learnt, it has to be noted that your opinions and experiences may vary and I greatly respect that.</em></p>
<h2 id="most-people-dont-do-easy-things-youcan">Most People Don&rsquo;t Do Easy Things. You Can!</h2>
<p>There are tons of things that are easy and obvious but very few of us can get them done. 
You don&rsquo;t have to move the whole world to stand out in the Software Engineering Market (although doing that would be helpful). You just have to do obvious things, but here is a catch.
We have a general thinking that we need to do something that is out of the world and people will appreciate that. This mindset is common since we see those high-performers doing things that get noticed everywhere and makes us think that we need to do extraordinary things to reach that level. 
Confused? Let me give an example: Some of the best software engineers have blogs and thousands of people read them regularly. A few of them are web developers, others are embedded engineers and so on. They belong to a diverse field, but they are doing one simple and obvious thing that you can do right now: Blogging. 
Now this one is just an example of a simple thing that these people do that stands out way more than you think. There are a lot of things like podcasts and projects that would help you gain that popularity, but something is keeping you back. 
<strong>Highlight this: You can have the best and the rarest skills in the world, but they become useless if you keep them within you and refrain from showing people.</strong> 
I am not telling you to brag about your skills and unfair advantages, but letting people know about your proficiency would make you get better opportunities. 
And trust me, some people are working way up the corporate ladder than most people with way more skills than them.</p>
<h2 id="how-blogging-can-help-you-getnoticed">How Blogging Can Help You Get Noticed</h2>
<p>Think about this, how hard is writing blogs? 
As a writer, I can say that it takes like 1–2 hours to write a whole blog, straight from the mind. The research part is already done by you as a software developer, you just have to structure it and write it down. 
And if you are a web developer, nothing is better than starting your blog platform and spreading it all over your network. There are a lot of people who love reading, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter how much you know. There will always be people better than you and even worse than you. Those worse than you would like to read your blog and learn from it. 
The most important thing about writing blogs is that recruiters and startup owners do read blogs and it&rsquo;s one of the ways for them to know your approach to a particular subject. Like think about this: Imagine you are a Kernel Developer and you have awesome projects under your belt. But it&rsquo;s pretty difficult to show people what it doing since fewer people understand Linux Kernel Development (than web developers). And even if someone understands it, compiling and looking that out has a lot of friction. And recruiters, don&rsquo;t have that much time to check you out. 
So if you have a blog post (or a series of blog posts), then they can read about it, and even know your journey (it&rsquo;s better than explaining your journey in an interview). Engage them and facilitate them. 
So even if there are other people with better projects, your articles would provide a more frictionless path to displaying as much as you can, giving you an unfair advantage.</p>
<h2 id="podcasts-are-the-ultimate-gamechanger">Podcasts are the Ultimate Game Changer</h2>
<p>Speaking is a skill set and if you know how to convey your ideas and experiences clearly and engagingly, there are tons of people who would love listening to you (even recruiters). 
Podcasts have much less friction on both sides, creator and consumer. Day by Day, fewer and fewer people are reading articles by other fellow developers. And a lot of times, listening can be a better way to learn in a busy schedule. 
On your side, it&rsquo;s more comfortable than typing (in my opinion) and would motivate you further about keeping consistency. 
Although there is a bit of monetary friction involved here (which is a tradeoff made with typing comfort). You need recording equipment, but I think you can start with a basic mic and move on to buy condensers, stands, etc. 
In the future, recording yourself can be easier in the case of podcasts since once you get enough audience, talking with gestures and actions would become more expressible.</p>
<h2 id="make-combinations-of-skills-these-are-the-rarest-ofall">Make Combinations of Skills (These are the Rarest of all)</h2>
<p>Rate this combination: Blockchain Developer + Embedded Engineer
There are a lot fewer people in this background than individual Blockchain Developers and Embedded Engineers. 
In a company focusing on consumer electronics and wants to integrate blockchain into it for integrity, you are the one in highlight. 
One of the best things that I have seen with top performers is a combination of skills. Learning diverse skills can help you boost your portfolio, and display a wide range of interests. Usually, these people are the most enthusiastic about adapting newer technologies and companies love this kind of people. 
And this is obvious, like if you are a UI Designer, taking photography as a skill would make a lot of sense, since you would be getting your images without purchasing them, making you a better option than traditional UI designers. 
This would give you an unfair advantage by just learning something related to your expertise which is rare among your fellow professionals.</p>
<h2 id="show-your-work-what-is-seen-issold">Show Your Work - What is Seen is Sold</h2>
<p>No one is going to come to you and see everything that you have done till now. You have to display it. 
If you have a certain skill and you want to get paid for that, you need to show up and show people your work. If the right people don&rsquo;t know about your work, there is no chance that they are going to hire you with just a resume. 
Let me give an example: If you are trying to get a job as a technical writer, you should write blogs and show your recruiters your writing rather than cold emailing the hiring person with a bunch of names of projects mentioned. So your message to the recruiter can look like this: 
&ldquo;Hey XYZ! This is Aditya and I would love to work for your startup as a writer. I went through your organisation and I think there are a few places where I can add my expertise. I have written a blog post for your product and you are free to post it to your site. And if you want me to write more articles for your blog and also develop a newsletter, contact me to know my pricing.&rdquo;
That&rsquo;s it, it was much better than just a page of resume. First of all, they know how you write about their product and second is your attitude towards growing their startup. 
And this is the power of showing your work. As compared to providing a resume with hundreds of skills, showing what you can do with your skillset can make a huge difference. 
And even if you are of a different background, blogs and podcasts can also show your work. Like if you are a security engineer and provide security services to companies, writing about the latest vulnerabilities and attacks can show your ability to be updated with current updates.</p>
<h2 id="reach-out-people-no-worries-if-you-are-an-introvert">Reach Out People - No Worries if You are an Introvert</h2>
<p>Meeting people in person is great, but if you are an introvert, social media can help you a lot. 
To show your work, you need people. One of the best ways to find people is to use social media sites and find people working in that profession. A person working in the same field for a long time has a lot of connections and a bigger network which can be exposed to you if you know that person. And usually, having a big network can help you spread your word. If you are writing articles, there might be people in your network who might be interested in them, and those who are not would share them in their network. 
It&rsquo;s okay to be an introvert, you can connect with people online. But I would recommend that you attend meetups and workshops. A lot of people who have similar interests attend them, and a lot of recruiters attend them to find people interested in that particular thing. Needless to say, you would find a lot of people that might help you in your journey. 
And this big network is another unfair advantage that you would have over your fellow developers.</p>
<h2 id="build-things-that-are-visible-topeople">Build Things that are Visible to People</h2>
<p>Build things that help people so that they can help you. 
Building projects is one of the best ways to show your work. For growing your audience and showing your work to more people, build meaningful projects that would get a thing done for another person. For example, for web developers, building usual applications to prove that you can get it done might help fill your resume. But if your website gets something done for another person (like converting an Image to a PDF), people would like to come again and again to use it. Eventually, you will get found. 
You don&rsquo;t need multiple mediocre projects, one high-impact project can make a huge difference. 
This is an unfair advantage over those people with like 5 mediocre (replicable) projects on their resume by having one project that you are known for.</p>
<h2 id="become-indispensable-with-unfair-advantages">Become Indispensable with Unfair Advantages</h2>
<p>These are a few things that would give you an unfair advantage over other people who are trying to take your place. 
And Trust me, still, not a lot of people are going to get this done. If you have reached this point of the article, you are among those few people who are serious about doing this. And still, very few of them will go and execute. So you are safe to do them. 
These unfair advantages are not something that you are born with. And doing at least one of them can make a huge impact. Just writing 1 blog in a week and uploading it to any content platform with a decent amount of audience would help you get spotted better than those who didn&rsquo;t.</p>

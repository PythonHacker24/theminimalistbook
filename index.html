<p>Welcome to the Minimalist Book, a site on the web maintained by me. Here, you will find my writings related to a lot of stuff related to computers, electronics, idealogies and philosophy, mostly related to computers. This is a <strong>Static Website</strong> developed with <strong>Hugo</strong> with the theme <strong>Digital Garden</strong>.</p>

<p>On this website, you would find no distractions of trackers, allowing you to have freedom while you surf. It&rsquo;s minimal and simple, which I believe is the very basic requirements for learning in depth. This place is free and open to use, promoting access to information to everyone. You are not required to sign-in as there is no purpose for me to know you as you learn.</p>

<h1 id="about-the-author">About the Author</h1>
<h2 id="hey-i-am-aditya-">Hey, I am Aditya 👋</h2>
<p>I am <strong>Aditya Patil</strong>, a Ethical Hacker, Software Developer and Electrical Engineer focusing on <strong>Hardware Security</strong> and <strong>Operating Systems</strong>. For me, computers and circuits are are different world to live in and I often love writing about them. This is my website where I write about a lot of things that might be useful to you.</p>
<h2 id="technical-background">Technical Background</h2>
<p>My field of interest is <strong>Computers and Electronics</strong>. They both seem like a general overview, but is kind of not! I love studying all of it. For me, I see them in one place and I look for learning more and decode them. The love for computers was early in my life, and has become a part of life now. My computer terminal like whole life and I spend like more than half of my day working on it. When I am not, I am always hacking some electronic devices (I love router vulnerability analysis).</p>
<p>I have experience working with Cloud, Deployments, DevSecOps, etc. and keep working knowledge of Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Suppy Chain Management, etc. Apart from them, I learned the Blockchain Technology especially on the Ethereum Platform and explored Solana (Rust is ❤️). Corium, etc. I found myself much engaged in low-level computer stuff, eventually reaching the Embedded Electronics line and Operating Systems. It&rsquo;s a long journey to conquer them all, but that&rsquo;s what makes it more better. I can do it all day.</p>
<h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty evident by the title that I am a <strong>Minimalist</strong> and like to keep things simple. The lens of <strong>simplicity</strong> is clear and beautiful to look into, especially when it comes to topics related to engineering that are made complex to prove nothing.</p>
<p>This philosphy is especially included when I am learning and working on something. Learning and writing are related, and require hours of deep work in isolation. I like to work alone in silence (some ambient music helps sometimes) with work done in the most simple and elegant way possible. <strong>Productivity is satisfaction</strong>, especially when the outcome is the better and smarter version of me after the deep work session.</p>
<h2 id="readings-and-writings">Readings and Writings</h2>
<p>I read books related to my field of interest and philosophy, especially stoicism (and maybe sometimes novels ✨). This is where I get my ideas from and what get&rsquo;s on the paper while I write articles.</p>
<p>I started writing when I realised that I had some knowledge about my field of interests and may come to use for anyone randomly looking for something. I decided to write on <strong>Medium</strong>. It&rsquo;s a great plaform to spread the word, but I needed something where there is no authority and I have freedom to write.</p>
<p>I am not the best writer, especially not a professional writer. But the ones that inspired me where neither one of them. Writing is a way of expressing knowledge, much different than a video and audio. Expressing the way the writer thinks and feels about certian topic is evident in the writings. Desipte the fact of my camera conciousness, writing became the way.</p>
<p>A few book recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Computers:</strong> <em>Linux Kernel Development (Robert Love), Hacking: The Art of Exploitation (Jon Erickson), Linux in a Nutshell (Ellen Siever, Stephen Figgins, Robert Love and Arnold Robbins), Linux Kernel in a Nutshell (Greg Kroah-Hartman), The Art of Electronics (Paul Horowitz and Winfield Hill).</em></li>
<li><strong>Stoicism:</strong> <em>Letters from a Stoic (Seneca), Meditations (Marcus Aurelius), On the Shortness of Life (Seneca), Ego is the Enemy (Ryan Holiday).</em></li>
<li><strong>Must Reads:</strong> <em>Psychology of Money (Morgan Housel), Linchpin (Seth Godin), Atomic Habits (James Clear), The Mountain is You (Brianna Wiest), Deep Work (Cal Newport)</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="educational-background">Educational Background</h2>
<p>I am currently studying <strong>Electrical Engineering</strong> from the <strong>National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur</strong>. Since this is a formal educational data, that proves almost nothing. Formal education was never my companion, especially becoming a reason to hate books for most of my life till now. Electronics and Computers where something that kept me awake at night to develop tools that can secure the cyberspace, but got replaced by some wierd social inteluctual customs.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love studying. I did love Physics, Mathematics (but never got good grades) and some amount of Chemistry. I enjoyed studying them and still part of me wander around the books the study them. But I believe that studying is somthing that must be done to satisfy the curiosity, the get amazed and learn about the world we live in. This was something that I realised lately after losing some of my naivety (although it still exists).</p>
<p>This is one of the reason that motivated me to come up with the Minimalist&rsquo;s Book. My work is dedicated to open up the knowledge and make it reachable to everyone. I make efforts to make my writings as simple to understand as I can and in an intuitive way, something that a wide range of materials lack to provide and make things seem less cooler than they are.</p>
